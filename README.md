# IMI-Big-Data-Competition---Team-35
IMI Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Competition

# Task 1 (Supervised learning)
- Building supervised learning models for predicting ‘very high risk’ clients.
- Risk is indicative of general money laundering.
- Opportunity to explore multiple models and data sources.
- Very imbalanced: 2% positive label.


# Task 2 (Finding IWT networks)
- Finding wildlife trafficking networks in the data.
- Some cases might easily be found, while others need more careful exploration.
- There are no labels within data. Students will have to judge
what is related to wildlife trafficking and what is not.

# Task 3 (Entity extraction and resolution)
- Find known wildlife traffickers from the web.
- Websites as far back as 2012.
- Too many news outlets to check -> crawling.
- Cross-reference with provided data and resolve any suspicious entities.
